# Module 15 Challenge

## Background

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The instructions for this activity are broken into two parts:

• Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization

• Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data (Optional with no extra points earning)


Dataset provided by the USGS. ( http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php )

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The resulting website is hosted here on GitHub Pages ( https://mark-helotie.github.io/leaflet-challenge/ ).

I chose to display ALL earthquakes for the previous one day.

Also, I added a clickable link in the pop-up for "More Details..." that sends you to the USGS website with specifics on that earthquake itself.

## NOTE: I have combined Part 1 and Part 2 into the same single map/website.

There is a selection box in the upper right corner to enable/disable the display of Earthquakes and/or Tectonic Plates.
